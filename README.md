# A Journey Of begin again my new life

------
My name is Jack, a little boy form Chengdu, China. I'm learning Android Development on my own. And I'm seeking for a job.

I worked for PwC SDC Chengdu for about 7 months as an IT intern. After my graduation, I went to a place where are closer to my dream of flying.

When I worked at Sichuan Province Airport Group Company (Chengdu International Airport) one year later. I found that I don't like here even I want to escape from airport. I don't want to live of mediocrity and just waiting for my retirement. I am young, wild and free and I want challenges
