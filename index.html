<hr>

<p>My name is Jack, a little boy form Chengdu, China. I'm learning Android Development on my own. And I'm seeking for a job.</p>

<p>I worked for PwC SDC Chengdu for about 7 months as an IT intern. After my graduation, I went to a place where are closer to my dream of flying.</p>

<p>But when I worked at Sichuan Province Airport Group Company (Chengdu International Airport) one year later. I found that I don't like there even I want to escape from the airport. I don't want to live of mediocrity and just waiting for my retirement. I am young, wild and free and I want challenges.</p>

<p>I'm greatly inspired by Kai Fu-Lee when I read his autobiography <em>Making a world of difference</em>, I know what I want now. I love the rapid development of the Internet, and I hope that with the rapid development of mobile Internet in this golden age and I can growing together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
