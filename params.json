And I'm seeking for a job.\r\n\r\nI worked for PwC SDC Chengdu for about 7 months as an IT intern. After my graduation, I went to a place where are closer to my dream of flying.\r\n\r\nBut when I worked at Sichuan Province Airport Group Company (Chengdu International Airport) one year later. I found that I don't like there even I want to escape from the airport. I don't want to live of mediocrity and just waiting for my retirement. I am young, wild and free and I want challenges.\r\n\r\nI'm greatly inspired by Kai Fu-Lee when I read his autobiography *Making a world of difference*, I know what I want now. I love the rapid development of the Internet, and I hope that with the rapid development of mobile Internet in this golden age and I can growing together.\r\n\r\n> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\r\n",
